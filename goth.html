      <p>
        "Um Yeah, I don't really like him, you know, they think they're so much
        better than me. I feel like, you know, I'll be looking at them and be
        like, shit, bro, like, come on, man, just enjoy life, and they're like
        piz off like the hell bro. And, like, you know, I just I'm tired of it,
        man. Just like, enjoy life for once, come on, guys, there are so many
        things to it, so much stuff to do, come on."
      </p>
      <h2>Thoughts on their style?</h2>
      <p>
        "It's actually yeah... Pretty good, actually. Can't complain. It's just
        their mentality. I don't care too much for that."
