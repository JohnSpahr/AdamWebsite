          I think we've all wanted to become Adam at some point or another. As
          the webmaster, I know I have. Thus, I have compiled this list of
          Adamisms so you can become Adam, too:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Be nonchalant, like hella. A true Adam never exhibits chalant traits
            with one major exception...
          </li>
          <li>
            Be chalant for comedic purposes. But never be chalant in any other
            contexts. Only in humorous situations.
          </li>
          <img src="res/images/wowza.gif" alt="WAFFLES" />
          <li>
            Follow Math Powerland on social media. His research in the flat
            earth field has been groundbreaking. He also has amazing style. He's
            essentially the anti-dork.
          </li>
          <li>
            Learn everything about 2010s pop, and I do mean everything. You have
            to know all the hits. If you don't... Well... Good luck ever
            becoming Adam, buster.
          </li>
          <img src="res/images/ok.gif" alt="hmmm" />
          <li>Don't be evil.</li>
          <img src="res/images/evil.gif" alt="EVILLLLL" />
          <li>Visit the GOON CHAIRS daily. Ifykyk.</li>
          <li>
            Listen to Geek Bar pop music every single day. Hit the Geek Bar
            while you're at it. Perhaps even get geeked.
          </li>
          <li>
            Always believe in yourself. Adam has no self-doubt. He's too
            nonchalant for that shit.
          </li>
          <li>Marry Avril Lavigne every few days.</li>
          <img src="res/images/avril.gif" alt="jsyk" />
          <li>
            Do unhinged shit and grin until the recipient is uncomfortable. Or
            side eye them if they're pissing you off. Let them know that they're
            pissing you off.
          </li>
          <li>Get the bands. If you broke, you never finna be Adam.</li>
          <li>
            Visit the Adam Website twice a day for the latest Adam news and
            happenings.
          </li>
          <li>Beat up your opps.</li>
          <li>Love all cats.</li>
          <img
            src="res/images/kittycat.gif"
            alt="meow"
            style="background: #fff"
          />
          <li>
            Become addicted to Brawl Stars and Clash Royale. Real Adams do that.
          </li>
          <li>Niche Fruits. You love 'em.</li>
          <li>6-7. Lol!</li>
          <li>Be nice and awesome at every very moment in time.</li>
        </ol>
