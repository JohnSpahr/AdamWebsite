      <h1>Who is this Adam?</h1>
      <img src="res/images/adam.png" alt="ADAM" />
      <p>
        Adam is a man with the various spectrum of traits you have come to
        expect from those you encounter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adam is neither here nor there. He is constantly on the move, ready to
        seize any opportunity that heads his way.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page aims to be the number one source of all Adam-related things.
      </p>
      <h3>For example, look at this photo of Adam:</h3>
      <img
        src="res/images/board.png"
        alt="Adam goes surfing"
        width="90%"
        style="max-width: 600px"
      />
      <p>
        As you can see, Adam is partaking in an activity he hates: Surfing.
        However, for reasons soon to be explained, it is means to an end for
        Adam. It is important to recognize that Adam will endure harsh
        circumstances in order to fulfill his ambitions.

      <p>
        "I don't think it's as bad as everyone says it is, you know? Um, I feel
        like in a lot of other parts of the world, there are people mass
        producing. Especially like the Asian countries. We have a problem with
        consumerism there. You know, maybe, actually... My whole opinion is it's
        just not as bad as what people say it is, you know?"

      <p>
        "Um, I think there's a certain point, you know, AI has gotten to into

        think the uh it's very important to have the worldwide web, especially
        in the world like today, you know, but um uh, the way it's advancing, uh
        especially using AI might be a little concerning for like, uh, uh some
        some like, uh information producers or like, uh, people, I don't know,
        you know, no, I don't know. I... It's good."

      <h2>An interview with [REDACTED] at [REDACTED]:</h2>
      <h3>What's your history w/ Adam?</h3>
      <p>
        "Uh, we go pretty far back. We actually used to cut down trees around
        Big Boga, 'cause, you know, we had a home there. But after the falling
        out, we didn'y really talk for, like, a couple thousand years. But then
        we became friends again (in 32 B.C.) after finding a hippopotamus or
        something. And we killed it together."

      <h3>What are your thoughts on the Adam Bigfoot allegations?</h3>
      <p>
        "Uh, those are completely true. He was Bigfoot. He was actually the guy.
        No suit. He's not changed; he just shaves all his hair now. He looks
        vaguely human now."
